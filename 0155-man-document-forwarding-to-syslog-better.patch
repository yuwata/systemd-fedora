+
+    <para>
+      Journal events can be transfered to a different logging daemon
+      in two different ways. In the first method, messages are
+      immediately forwarded to a socket
+      (<filename>/run/systemd/journal/syslog</filename>), where the
+      traditional syslog daemon can read them. This method is
+      controlled by <varname>ForwardToSyslog=</varname> option.  In a
+      second method, a syslog daemon behaves like a normal journal
+      client, and reads messages from the journal files, similarly to
+      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>journalctl</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
+      In this method, messages do not have to be read immediately,
+      which allows a logging daemon which is only started late in boot
+      to access all messages since the start of the system. In
+      addition, full structured meta-data is available to it. This
+      method of course is available only if the messages are stored in
+      a journal file at all. So it will work if
+      <varname>Storage=none</varname> is set. It should be noted that
+      usualy the <emphasis>second</emphasis> method is used by syslog
+      daemons, so the <varname>Storage=</varname> option, and not the
+      <varname>ForwardToSyslog=</varname> option, is relevant for them.
