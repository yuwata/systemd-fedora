Subject: [PATCH] journal: fix Inappropriate ioctl for device on ext4

Logs constantly show

systemd-journald[395]: Failed to set file attributes: Inappropriate ioctl for device

This is because ext4 does not support FS_NOCOW_FL.

[zj: fold into one conditional as suggested on the ML and
     fix (preexisting) r/errno confusion in error message.]

(cherry picked from commit 65eae3b76243d2dfd869f8c43b787575f7b4b994)
